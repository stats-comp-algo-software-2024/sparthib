# Test the are_all_close() function. Write a test to cover at least three cases:
# the function 1) correctly returns TRUE, 2) correctly returns FALSE because the relative error
# is above rel_tol, and 3) correctly returns FALSE because the absolute error is above abs_tol.
# Make sure that the logic of the test is clear and easy to understand â€” tests are there to clarify
# and validate the code's behavior; unreadable tests defeat the purpose.
# <br> Remark: This is just an exercise, but in general there is nothing strange about
# testing a function you use to test another function. It is perfectly reasonable to consider
# testing any functions complicated enough to potentially contain insiduous bugs.
